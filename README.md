# THUNDERBOOT
THUNDERBOOT is a device that works as an intermediate between your embedded system in development and the code on your laptop. With this you do not need an SD-card that you move Â back and forth. Instead, you can simply plug one end of the ThunderBoot to your laptop and the other end to your device. Then you can Boot directly from the laptop with a single click, no more running back and forth.

-Reading Speed: 10 Mb/sec
#### Hardware

-Powered by USB, micro-USB.
-FPGA: Intel MAX10.

## Philosophy and contributions
We want to keep it stupid simple in order to make it as easy as possible for any developer to modify and write his or her own scripts around it. We are also working on some planned features which you can read more about in the wiki (LINK), where you can also find inspiration for contributions and suggest more features.

- Provides the possibility to run series of boot images for testing multiple cases.
- Automated result gathering.

## Getting Started

The THUNDERBOOT comes with a linking program which is used to link one area of the computer with the memory card.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
